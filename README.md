# Bayesian and AI-Driven Speech Recognition for Enhanced Sports Commentary Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents a novel speech recognition framework tailored for **sports commentary analysis**. By integrating Bayesian inference with adaptive AI techniques, our system delivers robust transcription and interpretation of complex, fast-paced sports commentary — even in noisy environments. The framework is designed to enhance real-time insights, automated broadcasting, and structured linguistic analysis in sports media.

## Project Name
**BayesCommentary** — A concise name highlighting the Bayesian and commentary-focused nature of the project.

## Key Components

### 1. Adaptive Statistical Representation Model (ASRM)
- Dynamically adjusts model parameters based on input complexity.
- Enhances flexibility, interpretability, and generalization.
- Learns commentary-specific features such as pacing, tone, and domain vocabulary.

### 2. Dynamic Bayesian Optimization Strategy (DBOS)
- Refines speech-to-text performance using probabilistic optimization.
- Leverages variational inference and multi-scale learning techniques.
- Improves accuracy and robustness in real-world noisy sports broadcast conditions.

## Motivation

Standard ASR systems often fail in sports contexts due to:
- Fast-paced and unscripted speech patterns.
- Overlapping speakers and significant background noise.
- Domain-specific jargon and linguistic nuances.

Our proposed framework addresses these issues with a probabilistic and adaptive approach, providing improved transcription quality and robustness in dynamic conditions.

## Features

- Real-time sports commentary transcription.
- Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware predictions.
- Multi-scale optimization for robustness in noisy environments.
- Structured speech outputs for downstream analytical tasks.
